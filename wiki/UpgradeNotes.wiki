#Upgrading from `cfgparse-0.1`

= History =

This project used to be called `cfgparse`. It was renamed in July 2007 to avoid being confused with another
project on SourceForge with the same name.  In the process of renaming the project, the API was cleaned
up a bit.

= API Changes =

The backward compatible classes in `iniparse.compat` are unchanged (naturally). The "native" API has
changed a bit.  Here's the mapping from old names to new names:

`ini_namespace` --> `INIConfig`
`basic_namespace` --> `BasicConfig`
`namespace` --> `ConfigNamespace`
`.import_namespace()` --> `.import_config()`

Many other internal names have changed, but most user code should not notice any changes.

Another change is that the major classes are directly available in the `iniparse` module, rather than submodules.  For example:

{{{
from iniparse import ConfigParser
cfg = ConfigParser()
# ... etc.
}}}
