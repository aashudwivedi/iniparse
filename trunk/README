cfgparse is a Python module that provides mechanisms for managing
configuration information. It is backward compatible with
ConfigParser, in addition to having the following features:

* Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options,
  indentation (to some extent), comments, and blank lines are
  preserved when data is updated.

* More convenient than ConfigParser: Values can be accessed using
  dotted notation, or using container syntax (cfg[key]).

* Backward compatibility: Backward compatible implementations of
  ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included
  that are API-compatible with the Python standard library. They
  pass all the unit tests in Python-2.3.4.

* Extensible: It is possible to add other configuration formats,
  and to convert between different formats (as long as the data
  models are compatiable).
