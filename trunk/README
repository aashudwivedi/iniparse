cfgparse is a Python module that implements basic mechanisms for
managing configuration information. It is compatiable with ConfigParser
while preserving the structure of INI files (i.e. order of sections &
options, comments, blank lines are preserved) and allows convenient
access to data.  Compatiability has been tested using the unit tests
included with Python-2.3.4.
