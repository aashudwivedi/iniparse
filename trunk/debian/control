Description: An INI parser for Python
 iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:
    * Compatiable with ConfigParser: Backward compatible implementations of 
      ConfigParser, RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that 
      are API-compatible with the Python standard library. They pass all the 
      unit tests in Python-2.4.4. 
    * Preserves structure of INI files: Order of sections & options, 
      indentation, comments, and blank lines are preserved as far as possible 
      when data is updated. 
    * More convenient: Values can be accessed using dotted notation 
      (cfg.user.name), or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']). 
 It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by 
 programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config file 
 completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also allows 
 making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is desirable 
 in applications like image galleries.
